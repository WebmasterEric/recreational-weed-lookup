Recreational Weed Lookup (21+)

A lightweight recreational weed and marijuana lookup utility for strain discovery and informational context.

This project demonstrates a city-focused strain lookup hub that allows adults 21+ to search for recreational cannabis strains by name and navigate to strain-specific informational pages.

Information only. No sales. No delivery.

What this is

Recreational Weed Lookup is a simple, client-side utility designed to make strain discovery easier without menus, ordering systems, or marketplace features.

The core function is straightforward:
	•	Users search for a strain by name
	•	Results route to informational strain pages
	•	Pages provide neutral, recreational-only context

The focus is on clarity, simplicity, and discoverability.

⸻

What this is not

This project is intentionally limited in scope.

It is not:
	•	A cannabis marketplace
	•	A delivery platform
	•	A dispensary directory
	•	A menu aggregator
	•	A sales or ordering system

All cannabis transactions remain entirely between users and licensed recreational dispensaries.

⸻

How it works
	•	The lookup interface runs entirely client-side
	•	No external APIs are required
	•	Results are filtered from a predefined list of strain pages
	•	Each strain page is designed to answer a specific lookup query

This repository provides a reference implementation of the lookup interface only.

⸻

City-focused design

The lookup model is intentionally city-based.

Each city can have:
	•	One lookup hub
	•	Multiple strain information pages

This structure keeps results relevant and avoids unnecessary duplication.

⸻

Intended use

This repository is suitable for:
	•	Demonstrating a strain lookup interface
	•	Educational or informational projects
	•	Embedding a lookup hub into a static site or CMS
	•	Reference implementations for client-side filtering

It is not intended to be used as a commercial sales platform.

⸻

Compliance and scope
	•	Recreational cannabis information only
	•	Adults 21 years of age or older
	•	No medical or medicinal content
	•	No sales, no delivery, no ordering

Availability information, if referenced, reflects public listings and may change at any time.

⸻

Repository contents

This repository includes:
	•	A demo lookup page (index.html)
	•	Sample strain data
	•	Basic styling for clarity and usability
	•	Documentation for embedding the lookup interface

It does not include backend systems, automation scripts, or operational tooling.
